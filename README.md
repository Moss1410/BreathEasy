TO DO
	1. Arduino code to interpret settings output serial string
		a. Should be similar to what we already have written in python for interpreting data
	2. Check with a test set of data if python correctly interprets the values
	3. Link all display boxes to the stored data
		a. Remove magic numbers
		b. Link Ranges and units to data dictionary
		c. Link Setting inputs to settings dictionary
	4. Figure out how to plot the input data
		a. What data needs to be plotted and presented on the main display page
	5. Make the thing not look bad
		a. This is probably on of the largest ones
	6. Display sample MATLAB data in the graphing windows that aren't plotting the potentiometer
	7. Work on graph colour scheme and readability
		a. Add scaling options if possible
		b. Add data selection to be displayed if possible
	8. Write documentation on how to use the program
		a. Probably wont need to be in depth
